This repository contains all the necessary scripts used in my UROP project in summer 2021. 

For a brief summary of what was done, look at [UROP poster.pdf](https://github.com/kyubin-l/urop/files/7315961/UROP.poster.pdf)
 and  [urop_writeup.pdf](https://github.com/kyubin-l/urop/files/7315962/urop_writeup.pdf).
